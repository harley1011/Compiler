Test cases can be found in the gtest.cpp file.

The example program files and their associated outputs are:
- simple_program.txt -> simple_program_out.txt, simple_program_errors.txt
- simple_program_with_errors.txt -> simple_program_with_errors_token_out.txt, simple_program_with_errors_out.txt
- large_program.txt -> large_program_out.txt, large_program
- large_program_2.txt -> large_program_out_2.txt, large_error_out_2.txt

COMPILATION AND EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS


FOR MAC
1. Install make

2. cd to the root of Compiler

3. Run the command "make"

4. src contains the executable exe which launches the program

5. cd to src

6. enter "./exe"

7. Follow the programs instructions

You can optionally pass three arguments to ./exe, the first argument being the program file, the second being the output file and lastly the error output

An example below is, the program file has to be in the same folder as exe or you have to give the full program path
./exe simple_program_with_errors.txt output_program.txt error_out_program.txt


The tests can also be ran by:

1. cd to tests

2. enter "./runUnitTes"
